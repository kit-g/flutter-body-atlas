# Context

## Goal
Interactive Flutter body atlas (muscles first) for pub.dev + fitness app integration.

## MVP
- Search muscles and focus/highlight
- Host app provides primary/secondary muscle engagement -> color map
- Tap muscle -> select + tooltip + emit event
- Front/back views (TBD)

## Key constraints
- SVG assets require manual IDs for muscles + groups
- CC BY 4.0 attribution required (package + app)
- Must be stable IDs (backwards compatible)

## Status
- Assets: present (needs IDs + metadata)
- Data model: TBD
- Rendering/hit testing: TBD
